**Definition:**  
This indicator measures how closely actual government expenditures align with the approved budget.  
It reflects the efficiency of fiscal planning and budget execution.

**Relevance:**  
- **Efficiency:** Assesses whether public spending adheres to planned allocations, minimizing budget deviations and cost overruns.  
- **Effectiveness:** Ensures that government expenditure remains within set limits, promoting fiscal discipline and stable public financial management.

**Proxy Justification:**  
The Public Expenditure Efficiency Index (Ratio of actual project costs to budgeted costs) is used to evaluate how well spending follows planned budgets.  
PEFA-WB’s Aggregate Expenditure Outturn is used as a proxy since it directly measures the extent to which government spending aligns with the approved budget.

**Definition:**  
This indicator measures whether government expenditures align with policy priorities, ensuring that funds are directed toward critical sectors such as education, health, and infrastructure.

**Relevance:**  
- **Efficiency:** Evaluates if public spending is allocated as planned, reducing inefficiencies and ensuring fiscal responsibility.  
- **Effectiveness:** Demonstrates whether financial resources are used to support sustainable development and social welfare.

**Proxy Justification:**  
The Expenditure Quality Score (Percentage of public spending directed toward development priorities) tracks whether expenditures are used for key sectors.  
PEFA-WB’s Expenditure Composition Outturn is used as a proxy because it assesses if resources are allocated according to national priorities, ensuring minimal waste.
