    Illicit financial flows (IFFs) are a critical challenge for domestic resource mobilization as they represent a significant loss of financial resources that could otherwise be used for development.  
    IFFs include practices like trade mispricing, tax evasion, corruption, and criminal activities. Addressing IFFs is essential to ensure that financial resources remain within the country and are directed toward development priorities.

#### Indicator 4.4.1.1: IFFs as a Percentage of GDP  
_(Proxied by Global Financial Integrity: Estimated Value of Illicit Financial Flows as a Proportion of GDP)_

**Definition:**  
This indicator measures the estimated value of illicit financial flows as a share of a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), reflecting the extent to which illicit capital flight affects economic stability.

**Proxy Justification:**  
Data from **Global Financial Integrity (GFI)** estimates IFFs as a percentage of GDP based on trade discrepancies, unrecorded capital movements, and other financial anomalies.

**Definition:**  
Trade mispricing occurs when importers or exporters deliberately misstate the price, quantity, or quality of goods and services to shift capital across borders illegally.

**Proxy Justification:**  
The trade value gap estimates from Global Financial Integrity provide an approximate measure of trade mispricing by analyzing mismatches in reported trade data.
