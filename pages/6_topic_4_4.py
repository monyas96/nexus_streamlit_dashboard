4.4.3.1. Effectiveness of Anti-IFF Measures 

This indicator assesses the efficacy of efforts to combat illicit financial flows (IFFs) by measuring successful prosecutions for IFF-related offenses. Given the challenges in obtaining direct prosecution data across jurisdictions, this study proxies effectiveness using the enablers framework outlined in Coherent Policies for Combatting Illicit Financial Flows (UNODC-OECD, 2016). 

Data Sources and Proxy Indicators 

The effectiveness of anti-IFF measures is assessed using multiple governance, regulatory, and institutional indicators that influence the ability to combat IFFs effectively. These proxies include: 

Regulation of Financial Markets: Captures the existence and enforcement of financial market regulations relevant to anti-IFF policies. 

Rule of Law (Regulatory Enforcement, Factor 6): Provided by the World Justice Project (WJP), measuring the extent to which regulations are fairly and effectively enforced. 

Rule of Law & Justice (Score and Rank): Measured by the Mo Ibrahim Index, reflecting the strength of legal institutions in preventing financial crimes. 

Reducing Corruption: Assessed using the World Bank's CPIA Transparency, Accountability, and Corruption rating, which scores the public sector's ability to prevent corruption. 

Sound Institutions: Evaluated using the CPIA Quality of Public Administration rating, indicating how well public institutions function in reducing financial crime risks. 

Identity Documentation: Sourced from the World Bank ID4D dataset, measuring the extent of legal identification coverage, crucial for tracking financial transactions and reducing anonymous illicit flows. 

Public Access to Information (Open Government, Right to Information): Analyzed using WJP's Open Government Indicator (Factor 3.2), which assesses transparency and citizens' access to government data. 

Calculation Approach 

Effectiveness is measured by compiling and analyzing the selected proxy indicators: 

Standardizing Scores: Normalize values across different indices to ensure comparability. 

Weighted Aggregation: Compute a composite measure reflecting overall effectiveness, with higher weights assigned to regulatory enforcement and corruption control. 

Trend Analysis: Assess progress over time to track improvements or declines in effectiveness. 

Rationale for Using These Proxies 

The UNODC-OECD framework identifies governance and institutional quality as key determinants of anti-IFF effectiveness. 

The World Justice Project, World Bank, and Mo Ibrahim Index provide validated, cross-country governance data relevant to financial crime control. 

Transparency and identity documentation are essential enablers for tracking and prosecuting illicit financial flows.

4.4.5. Impact on Development Finance

This section assesses the impact of illicit financial flows (IFFs) on development finance, focusing on reductions in financial leakages and improvements in government revenue collection. The analysis uses proxy indicators to measure the responsiveness of tax systems and the social impact of lost tax revenue.

**Data Sources and Proxy Indicators**

- **Tax Buoyancy:** Ratio of change in tax revenue in relation to change in gross domestic product (GDP) of an economy. Measures how responsive a taxation policy is to growth in economic activities.
- **Social Impact of Lost Tax:** Tax loss equivalent to the percentage of health and education budget (e.g., sotj20_loss_total_share_healthexpenses, all years).

**Calculation Approach**

- **Tax Buoyancy:** Calculated as the ratio of the percentage change in tax revenue to the percentage change in GDP over a given period.
- **Social Impact:** Assessed by comparing tax losses to government spending on health and education.

**Rationale for Using These Proxies**

- Tax buoyancy reflects the effectiveness of tax policy in mobilizing domestic resources for development.
- The social impact indicator highlights the opportunity cost of lost tax revenue for essential public services.

4.4.6. Policy and Regulatory Environment

This section assesses the implementation and effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing illicit financial flows (IFFs), with a focus on sector-specific regulations and rent sharing arrangements in the mining sector.

**Data Sources and Proxy Indicators**

- **Implementation of Anti-IFF Policies:** Number and effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing IFFs.
- **Specific Sectors:** Lists the laws and regulations that govern the taxation and mining activity of each country, including counts of general regime and mining regime.
- **Rent Sharing:** Examines rent sharing arrangements between the state and investors in the mining sector.

**Calculation Approach**

- **Policy Count:** Count the number of relevant laws and regulations for each country and sector.
- **Effectiveness Assessment:** Qualitatively or quantitatively assess the effectiveness of these policies where data is available.

**Rationale for Using These Proxies**

- The presence and quality of sector-specific regulations and rent sharing arrangements are key determinants of a country's ability to reduce IFFs, especially in resource-rich sectors like mining.
